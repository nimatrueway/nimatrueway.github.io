summary: |
  I have been a programming enthusiast since I was <b>12 years old</b>. I started by journey by developing <b>Delphi</b> and <b>C++</b> desktop apps. Then shifted to the amazing object-oriented cross-platform <b>Java</b> when I became an <b>undergraduate</b> student. And finally functional programming and developing <b>Scala</b> is what interested me <b>+2 years ago</b> and developed it since then.

  My <b>main</b> field of specialty is well-tested scalable <font color="#e18fb2"><b>backend development</b></font> (since <font color="#e18fb2"><b>4 years ago</b></font>) but I also have a good experience with <font color="#4a90e2"><b>web frontend</b></font> and <font color="#4a90e2"><b>desktop</b></font> development, and every once in a while I code and <font color="#4a90e2"><b>assist mobile</b></font> developers too.

  As you see I am not married to any role or any programming language, my <font color="#e18fb2"><b>1st priority</b></font> has always been to <font color="#e18fb2"><b>get the job done</b></font>. My <font color="#4a90e2"><b>2nd priority</b></font> is <font color="#4a90e2"><b>technical excellence</b></font>, and by that I mean the design with the <font color="#4a90e2"><b>least repetition</b></font>, and <font color="#4a90e2"><b>error</b></font>.

  I have a good <b>sense of humor</b>. I love working in a <b>small</b>, <b>casual</b> and <b>friendly</b> team of <font color="#e18fb2"><b>passionate</b></font> people. Life would be absurd, if we are not passionately doing something that <b>contributes to our world</b>.
