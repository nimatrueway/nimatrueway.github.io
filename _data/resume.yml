summary: |
  Complexity is what fascinates <b>specialists</b>, but <b>simplicity</b> is what gets the job actually done.

  Throughout my career I realized regardless of your role, or the language you use; you are still able to create an engineering masterpiece by carefully paying attention to your working <b>ecosystem</b>, using (or sometimes creating) the <b>right tool</b>, and come up with the <b>best combination</b>.

  Life is absurd, if you can not be <b>passionate</b> about something that contributes to the world. Passion is wonderfully contagious, I immensely enjoyed working with passionate people throughout my life and decided to <b>only</b> work with such people.
