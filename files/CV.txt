Complexity to some levels is necessary, as it gives space to innovation and an opportunity for a new world to emerge. It could be a poetic way of saying things, a piece of code that looks strange, etc.
Life is absurd, if you can not be passionate about something that contributes to the world. And passion is wonderfully contagious, I immensely enjoyed working with passionate people throughout my life and decided to ONLY work with such people.

- Amir Karimi [https://www.linkedin.com/in/amirkarimi/]
- Software Engineer at Walt Disney Streaming Services
- Amir directly managed Nima at ModernPal
  When I interviewed Nima on March 2016, he had not developed a single line of Scala code; Now he is one of the few professional Scala developers in Iran that I know of. Nima is an independent, smart, result-oriented young man who has a knack for solving difficult puzzles. In terms of personality, he has a great sense of humor.

- Behzad Mirkhanzadeh [https://www.linkedin.com/in/bmirkhanzadeh/]

- Behzad was Nima's co-worker at Intelligent Information Solutions Center
  I worked with Nima in the OSS project of Telecommunication Infrastructure Of Iran, Meanwhile we accomplished an extensive research work and published it in IEEE/IFIP NOMS 2016 Conference. He is one of the best and most skillful software developers I have ever seen. He implemented and designed the core module of the OSS which was very complex and challenging. His intelligence and hardworking attitude as well as great teamwork abilities make him an ideal software engineer, especially in stressful volatile environments. A company would be lucky to have him!

- Ali Sarshad [https://www.linkedin.com/in/ali-sarshad-2b4301a]
- Project Manager and UI/UX Designer
- Ali directly managed Nima at Tasvir Gostar Pasargad
  We met Nima, when we were in a severe time constraint and in need of a developer who is able to re-engineer our website and mobile application. Nima is a professional and experienced software developer, who does his job with extreme care and patience. A person who can be counted on in tough circumstances.

- Mahdi Azadbar [https://www.linkedin.com/in/mahdi-azadbar-a71b9710b/]

  Every time I think of a creative, talented and skillful developer, the first person that comes to my mind is Nima. He has a sharp vision in solving problems and sound knowledge in software development which enables him to learn and handle any new platform or language. Besides, Nima is very agreeable, has major commitment to his work and assists his colleagues by all means.

  We always discuss and have debate over technologies and he is a big fan of the cutting-edge technologies. Nima learns very fast, Not just fast but deep. Meticulousness is another good trait of him, When there is a problem he inspects all dimensions of the problem to come up with a reliable solution. Nima is smart, accurate and open-minded in software development, which is in fact the most important skill. Concerning his personality, I should say, he is kind, calm and introverted yet he has two big wings to fly. He is also open minded in life and is always ready to think twice about his choices.
